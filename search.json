    "text": "title: “First File” description: “Project Related Assignment 2” author: “Samantha Manuel” date: “03/12/2023” date-modified: “03/12/2023”\n\nProject Related Assignment 2 - Introduction\nData Description: Tate is an arts/cultural institution that holds the UK’s national collection of British, international modern, and contemporary art. This particular dataset includes metadata about the collection of artworks the Tate holds.\nLink to Data Source: Tate CSV File From the CORGIS Dataset Project\nMotivation for looking at the Data: I have always been interested in our GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) institutions and how we can increase accessibility and representation. For this reason, I am specifically looking at the museum’s acquisitions of international modern and contemporary art. When I started working at the J. Paul Getty Museum last summer and now at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), I had to learn about The Museum System (TMS) which is a museum management software used to track and catalog collections. Multiple modules exist on the platform: Object information, Constituents, Loans, Provenance research, Touring Schedules, Condition Reports, and much more (which was then exported to make this lovely data set). As a personal interest/goal, I aspire for an arts administration career and desire to learn more about increasing accessibility and advocacy within arts/culture-based institutions. I believe that I can accomplish this by also learning the ways in which coding/data analysis can be used to increase the transparency of operations and collections at GLAM institutions.\nQuestions that I’m seeking to address:\nGender Diversity. Are there any trends in acquisition, specifically in the accessions of women vs men? (looking also to maybe note under which museum Director the objects were acquired)\nCollection Diversity. Are there any trends or preferences that exist with the types of objects chosen to be a part of the collection?\nArtist Diversity. Are there any trends in the collection regarding the artist’s location of birth?\nAcquisition History. During which time periods were there more/less of a trend in acquiring artwork?\n\n\nSummary Information of Data\nThe data from the Tate CSV File, from the CORGIS Dataset Project, contains information about the artist (gender, name, role, birth year, birth location, year of death), artwork information (medium, thumbnail, title, url, dimensions), and metadata (aquisition dates, date of creation, credit).\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ntatedf = pd.read_csv('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/tate/tate.csv')\n\n\ntatedf\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      artist.gender\n      artist.name\n      artist.role\n      data.medium\n      data.thumbnail\n      data.title\n      data.url\n      dimensions.depth\n      dimensions.height\n      dimensions.width\n      metadata.acquisition date\n      metadata.creation decade\n      metadata.creation year\n      metadata.credit\n      artist.birth.location\n      artist.birth.year\n      artist.death.location\n      artist.death.year\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Female\n      Abakanowicz, Magdalena\n      artist\n      Burlap and resin\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T...\n      Backs\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abakanowic...\n      0.0\n      0.0\n      0.0\n      2009\n      1970\n      1976\n      Presented anonymously 2009\n      Polska\n      1930\n      NaN\n      0\n    \n    \n      1\n      Male\n      Abbey, Edwin Austin\n      artist\n      Ink on paper\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N03/N...\n      Illustration to Judith Shakespeare\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abbey-illu...\n      0.0\n      419.0\n      305.0\n      1924\n      1880\n      1883\n      Presented by a group of admirers through John ...\n      Philadelphia, United States\n      1852\n      London, United Kingdom\n      1911\n    \n    \n      2\n      Female\n      Abbott, Berenice\n      artist\n      Photograph, gelatin silver print on paper\n      NaN\n      Tri-Boro Barber Shop\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abbott-tri...\n      0.0\n      200.0\n      250.0\n      2010\n      1930\n      1935\n      Accepted by HM Government in lieu of inheritan...\n      Springfield, United States\n      1898\n      Monson, United States\n      1991\n    \n    \n      3\n      Male\n      Abbott, Lemuel Francis\n      artist\n      Oil paint on canvas\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T...\n      Portrait of the Engraver Francesco Bartolozzi\n      http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abbott-por...\n      0.0\n      676.0\n      756.0\n      1968\n      0\n      0\n      Presented by Mrs M.
